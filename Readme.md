## 🚗 CAR LICENSE PLATE DETECTION 

An intelligent License Plate Detection System built using YOLOv8, Streamlit, and EasyOCR, designed to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from both images and videos with high accuracy.

This project demonstrates how computer vision and deep learning can be combined to build a real-time, easy-to-use, and visually appealing application. Once an image or video is uploaded, the model identifies the license plate region, marks it with a green bounding box, and displays the confidence percentage above it. Below the output, the recognized license number and confidence score are neatly displayed for clarity.

All processed outputs (both images and videos) are automatically saved inside the output/ directory for later use.

## 📸 Features

✅ **Upload Images or Videos** — Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi`  
✅ **YOLOv8 Model Integration** — Pre-trained on license plate dataset for fast detection  
✅ **EasyOCR** — Reads alphanumeric license plate text  
✅ **Confidence Display** — Shows model confidence (%) above each bounding box  
✅ **Auto-save Outputs** — All predictions are saved to the `output/` directory  
✅ **Professional Streamlit UI/UX** — Clean, responsive layout with progress tracking  
✅ **Download Option** — Easily download processed results (image or video)
